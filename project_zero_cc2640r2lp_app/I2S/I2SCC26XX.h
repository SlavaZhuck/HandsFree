 *  @file       I2SCC26XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      I2S driver implementation for a CC26XX I2S controller.
 *
 *  The I2S header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/i2s/I2SCC26XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 * # Overview #
 * This driver is written specifically for the I2S module on CC26XX. The user
 * should be aware that although this module is called I2S it is a highly
 * configurable audio interface module. I2S is only one of many configurations.
 *
 * ## General Behavior #
 * Before using I2S on CC26XX:
 *   - The I2S driver object is initialized by calling I2SCC26XX_init(). This
 *     should be done in main before BIOS_start() is called.
 *   - The I2S system dependencies flags are set by calling I2SCC26XX_open().
 *     The driver is also taken. Prior to this the user should call
 *     I2SCC26XX_Params_init() to get the parameters to use in I2SCC26XX_open().
 *
 * While using I2S on CC26XX:
 *   - A stream is started, hardware configured and sleep prevented, when
 *     I2SCC26XX_startStream() is called. From now on callbacks are generated
 *     every time a buffer is ready; if callbacks are asked for.
 *   - Data is acquired by calling I2SCC26XX_requestBuffer(). Be sure to release
 *     buffer back to driver by calling I2SCC26XX_releaseBuffer().
 *   - The stream is stopped when I2SCC26XX_stopStream() is called. Note that
 *     this is a blocking call that will wait until the hardware has gracefully
 *     shut down. This will maximally take the same time that it takes to fill
 *     one buffer. The buffer size is configurable, so the time this function
 *     blocks is variable. System is allowed to sleep after
 *     I2SCC26XX_stopStream() is called.
 *
 * After I2S operation has ended:
 *   - Release system dependencies for I2S by calling I2SCC26XX_close().
 *
 *  ## Supported Functionality #
 * All possible configurations the I2S module can take are supported. However,
 * the user is encourage to use the I2SCC26XX_Params_init() function. Currently
 * the driver supports two configurations:
 *   - PDM
 *   - I2S (Note! Beta stage)
 *
 * ## Error handling #
 * Most APIs in this driver returns a boolean value indicating the success
 * or failure of the API. During streaming there is only one failure worth
 * discussing.
 * - Failure to provide new pointer to the I2S module (audio interface module)
 *      When stopping the stream this error is actually forced as it is part
 *      of the graceful shutdown sequence. It can however happen if the interrupt
 *      is not serviced in time, or there is no buffer available when serviced.
 *      - No buffer available:
 *              This error can happen if the caller does not request and release
 *              buffers fast enough to make sure at least one buffer is
 *              available for the driver. If this seems to be an intermittent
 *              unavoidable problem then it can be solved by providing a larger
 *              buffer to the driver.
 *      - Interrupt not serviced in time:
 *              This error can happen if interrupts are disabled, or another
 *              higher priority interrupt is being processed, for a duration
 *              longer than the time it takes to fill one buffer.
 * If the above mentioned error happens then the driver will notify the user
 * via the provided callback. It disables the pointer error interrupt, so that
 * it only generates this callback once. The user can now choose to process
 * the available buffers, before it must stop the stream. The user may, after
 * stopping the stream, restart the stream.
 *
 * ## Power Management #
 *  The I2SCC26XXDMA driver is setting a power constraint during stream to keep
 *  the device out of standby. When the stream has ended, the power
 *  constraint is released. The user is controlling the duration of the stream
 *  via calls to I2SCC26XX_startStream() and I2SCC26XX_stopStream().
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After I2SCC26XX_open(): the device is still allowed to enter standby.
 *    - During I2SCC26XX_startStream(): the device cannot enter standby.
 *    - After I2SCC26XX_stopStream() succeeds: the device can enter standby.
 *    - If I2SCC26XX_close() is called: the device can enter standby.
 *
 * ## Supported Functions ##

 * ## Use Cases \anchor USE_CASES_I2S ##
 * ### PDM Mode #
 *  Receive data until told to stop.
 *  @code
 *  I2SCC26XX_StreamNotification pdmStream;
 *  I2SCC26XX_Handle i2sHandle;
 *  I2SCC26XX_BufferRequest bufferRequest;
 *  I2SCC26XX_BufferRelease bufferRelease;
 *  I2SCC26XX_Params i2sCC26XX_params;
 *  I2SCC26XX_PDM_Params i2sCC26XX_PDM_params = {
 *      I2SCC26XX_CALLBACK_MODE,
 *      BIOS_WAIT_FOREVER,
 *      NULL,
 *      PDM_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SAMPLES,
 *      (void *) pdmContinuousBuffer,
 *      sizeof(pdmContinuousBuffer),
 *      (void *) pdmContMgtBuffer,
 *      sizeof(pdmContMgtBuffer),
 *      &pdmStream
 *  };
 *
 *  // Set callback function
 *  i2sCC26XX_PDM_params.callbackFxn = I2S_callbackFxn;
 *
 *  // Get PDM specific configuration
 *  I2SCC26XX_Params_init(&i2sCC26XX_params, I2SCC26XX_PDM, &i2sCC26XX_PDM_params);
 *
 *  // Then open the I2S
 *  I2SCC26XX_open(i2sHandle, &i2sCC26XX_params);
 *
 *  // Now you can start stream
 *  I2SCC26XX_startStream(i2sHandle);
 *
 *  // Wait for callback indicating buffers are ready. Typically this would
 *  // be in a thread waiting for a semaphore. The semaphore would be set in
 *  // the callback. In this case we're just assuming a volatile variable
 *  // bufferReady that is set in the callback
 *  while (!bufferReady);
 *  // Now request a buffer as it was indicated that one is available
 *  I2SCC26XX_requestBuffer(i2sHandle, &bufferRequest);
 *  // Process the buffer, e.g. perform PDM2PCM conversion
 *  ...
 *  // Then release the buffer after it has been processed
 *  // Release PDM buffer
 *  bufferRelease.bufferHandleIn = bufferRequest.bufferHandleIn;
 *  bufferRelease.bufferHandleOut = bufferRequest.bufferHandleOut;
 *  I2SCC26XX_releaseBuffer(i2sHandle, &bufferRelease);
 *
 *  // Now go back to waiting for next buffer, or stop stream
 *
 *  // After processing all buffers one can stop the stream
 *  I2SCC26XX_stopStream(i2sHandle);
 *
 *  // Then process all remaining buffers
 *  while (I2SCC26XX_requestBuffer(i2sHandle, &bufferRequest))
 *  {
 *      // Process the buffer, e.g. perform PDM2PCM conversion
 *      ...
 *      // Then release the buffer after it has been processed
 *      // Release PDM buffer
 *      bufferRelease.bufferHandleIn = bufferRequest.bufferHandleIn;
 *      bufferRelease.bufferHandleOut = bufferRequest.bufferHandleOut;
 *      I2SCC26XX_releaseBuffer(i2sHandle, &bufferRelease);
 *  }
 *
 *  // Then if we're really done, close the driver
 *  I2SCC26XX_close(i2sHandle);
 *
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Instrumentation #
 *  The I2SCC26XX driver has a debug mode that can be enabled compilation time.
 *  Use the flag I2S_DEBUG to enable this mode. In debug mode all buffers are
 *  labeled to indicate where in the process it is. It can have 6 different
 *  states:
 *

 *  --------------------------- | --------------------- |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_NO_QUEUE     | not part of queue     |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_AVAIL_QUEUE  | part of available     |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_READY_QUEUE  | part of ready         |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_NEXT         | next                  |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_ACTIVE       | active                |
 *  NODE_INDICATOR_USER         | handled by user       |
 *
 *  # TODOs #
 *  * More optimized buffer management might be supported in later releases.
 *  * Complete ::I2SCC26XX_I2S_Params and enable I2S mode
